# TODO List for Fixing Category Text and Image Visibility

- [x] Update CategoryBar.jsx: Change inactive button background to 'bg-gray-100/80' and text to 'text-gray-800' for better contrast.
- [x] Update MobileDishCard3D.jsx: Increase image opacity to 70% and reduce overlay opacity to make images more visible.
